["1. The first step in migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found in the static source code analysis. The first issue is to replace the `javax.json` import statements with `jakarta.json` import statements. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which includes the `jakarta.json` package. The `javax.json` package is part of the older Java EE API.\n\n2. To update the import statements, we simply need to replace `javax.json` with `jakarta.json` in each import statement. This will ensure that the code uses the correct package for working with JSON data in Quarkus.\n\n3. After updating the import statements, we can review the rest of the code to ensure that it is compatible with Quarkus. In this case, the code appears to be simple and straightforward, and there do not appear to be any other issues that need to be addressed.\n\n4. Therefore, the updated code for Quarkus is as follows:"]
