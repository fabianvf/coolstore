## Reasoning

1. The first thing to notice is that the package name is `com.redhat.coolstore.utils`, which is a package for utility classes. This class, `StartupListener`, is used to perform some actions when the application starts or stops.

2. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation indicates that this bean is application-scoped, meaning that it is created once per application and shared among all injections.

3. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject the `Log` object, which is a Quarkus-specific logging utility.

4. The `onStart` and `onStop` methods are called when the application starts and stops, respectively. They simply log a message indicating that the application has started or stopped.

5. The issue to fix is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package name instead of `javax`.

6. To fix the issue, we simply replace the `javax.inject.Inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject.Inject`.

7. No changes are required for the `io.quarkus.logging.Log` import statement, as it is a Quarkus-specific logging utility.

8. There are no external dependencies to update in the `pom.xml` file, as all the required dependencies are already included.

9. There are no changes required for the imports, as they are all correct and up-to-date.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import io.quarkus.runtime.ShutdownEvent;
import io.quarkus.runtime.StartupEvent;

@ApplicationScoped
public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Log log;

    void onStart(StartupEvent ev) {
        log.info("AppListener(onStart)");
    }

    void onStop(ShutdownEvent ev) {
        log.info("AppListener(onStop)");
    }

}
