["1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The input file uses the `javax.enterprise` package for the `@Produces` and `InjectionPoint` annotations. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.enterprise` package for these annotations. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise` on lines 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not annotated with any of these annotations. Therefore, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation. Additionally, the `log` field is not used in the `produceLog` method. Instead, we can use a `@Named` getter method to access the `log` field."]
