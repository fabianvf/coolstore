["1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The input file uses the `javax.enterprise` package for the `Produces` and `InjectionPoint` imports. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.enterprise` package for these imports. This is a breaking change in Jakarta EE 9, where the `javax.*` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta.*`. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n\n2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, CDI producer methods can be simplified by removing the `@Produces` annotation if the method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method can be simplified by removing the `@Produces` annotation. Additionally, the `log` field can be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead of being directly injected."]
