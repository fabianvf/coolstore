["1. **Issue 1 and 2**: The Java EE and Quarkus worlds use different packages for the same functionality. In this case, the `javax.enterprise` package is used in Java EE, while Quarkus uses the `jakarta.enterprise` package. This is a result of the transfer of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation and the subsequent name change to Jakarta EE. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise` on lines 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Issue 3**: In Quarkus, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans are more flexible regarding the use of annotations. Specifically, Quarkus allows us to omit the `@Produces` annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `@Produces` annotation is not necessary, and we can replace it with a `@Named` getter method to access the field. This change will make the code more idiomatic in Quarkus."]
