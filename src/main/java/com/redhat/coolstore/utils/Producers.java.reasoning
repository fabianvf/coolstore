["1. The first issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is because Java EE specifications have been migrated to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly. In Quarkus, we use the Jakarta EE packages.\n\n2. The second issue again highlights the need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is consistent with the first reasoning.\n\n3. The third issue suggests that in Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not required if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not using any specific features of the `InjectionPoint` class, so we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and the `InjectionPoint` parameter. Instead, we can use a `@Named` getter method to access the `log` field."]
