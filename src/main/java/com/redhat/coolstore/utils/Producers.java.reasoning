["1. In Quarkus, we need to use the `jakarta.enterprise` package instead of the `javax.enterprise` package. Therefore, I replaced all occurrences of `javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` with `jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces`.\n\n2. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. In this case, the `@Named` stereotype is used to inject the `Logger` instance. So, I removed the `@Produces` annotation and used the `@Named` stereotype instead."]
