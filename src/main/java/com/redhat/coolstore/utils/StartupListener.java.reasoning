["1. The `javax.inject` import statement is being replaced with `jakarta.inject`. This is a requirement for Quarkus as it uses the Jakarta Dependency Injection (JDI) standard.\n2. The `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` and `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` classes are being replaced with `jakarta.enterprise.event.Event` and `jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.Eventual` interfaces, respectively. Quarkus uses these interfaces for its event handling and dependency injection.\n3. The `@Inject` annotation is being replaced with `@Inject` from the Quarkus `kotlin-native` extension.\n4. The `Logger` class is being replaced with `Logging` from the Quarkus `kotlin-native` extension."]
