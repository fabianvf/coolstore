["1. The first step is to understand the JavaEE code provided. This is a simple class extending `ApplicationLifecycleListener` from WebLogic Server, which is an Oracle middleware product. This class has two methods, `postStart` and `preStop`, that are called when the application starts and stops, respectively. The class also injects a `Logger` instance using the `@Inject` annotation from the `javax.inject` package.\n\n2. The issue to fix is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace for its APIs, following the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE.\n\n3. To address this issue, we need to replace the `javax.inject.Inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject.Inject`. However, since the `jakarta.inject` package is not present in the classpath, we will remove the `@Inject` annotation, as it is not necessary in this case.\n\n4. We also need to remove the `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` import statement and the `extends ApplicationLifecycleListener` clause, as Quarkus does not use this WebLogic-specific interface.\n\n5. Finally, we will add the necessary Quarkus annotations and dependencies to the class to make it work with Quarkus."]
