["1. **Replace WebLogic Dependencies**: The input file uses WebLogic specific classes like `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` and `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener`. Quarkus does not support WebLogic, so we need to replace these dependencies with equivalent classes that are supported by Quarkus. In this case, we can use the `jakarta.application.StartupEvent` and `jakarta.application.ShutdownEvent` classes from the Jakarta EE API.\n\n2. **Replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`**: The input file uses `javax.inject.Inject` for dependency injection. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package for dependency injection. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n\n3. **Implement `ApplicationScoped`**: Since Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, we need to annotate our `StartupListener` class with `@ApplicationScoped` to ensure that a single instance of the class is created for the entire application.\n\n4. **Replace `postStart` and `preStop` methods**: Since we are replacing WebLogic specific classes, we need to replace the `postStart` and `preStop` methods with equivalent methods that are supported by Quarkus. In this case, we can use the `onStartup` and `onShutdown` methods from the `jakarta.application.ApplicationListener` interface."]
