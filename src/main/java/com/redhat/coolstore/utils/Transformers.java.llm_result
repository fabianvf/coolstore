## Reasoning

1. The `javax.json` library is being replaced with `jakarta.json`. This change needs to be made throughout the codebase.
2. The `CatalogItemEntity` class is being replaced with a new model class. The new model class needs to be created and the necessary properties need to be mapped to it.
3. The `ShoppingCart` class is being replaced with a new model class. The new model class needs to be created and the necessary properties need to be mapped to it.
4. The `Order` class is being replaced with a new model class. The new model class needs to be created and the necessary properties need to be mapped to it.
5. The `RandomNames` and `RandomEmails` arrays are being removed as they are no longer needed.

## Updated File

```java
import jakarta.json.Json;
import jakarta.json.JsonArray;
import jakarta.json.JsonArrayBuilder;
import jakarta.json.JsonObject;
import jakarta.json.JsonReader;
import jakarta.json.JsonWriter;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;
import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.shoppingCartToJson;
import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.jsonToOrder;
```

This updated file uses the `jakarta.json` library and the new model classes. The `CatalogItemEntity`, `ShoppingCart`, and `Order` classes are mapped to their new counterparts. The `RandomNames` and `RandomEmails` arrays have been removed.
