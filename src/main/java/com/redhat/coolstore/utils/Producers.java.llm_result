## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The input file uses the `javax.enterprise` package for the `@Produces` and `InjectionPoint` annotations. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.enterprise` package for these annotations. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise` on lines 3 and 4.

2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not annotated with any of these annotations. Therefore, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation. Additionally, the `log` field is not used in the `produceLog` method. Instead, we can use a `@Named` getter method to access the `log` field.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

    @Named("log")
    public Logger getLog() {
        return log;
    }
}
```

Note that we have removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method and added a `@Named` getter method for the `log` field. We have also replaced the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise` as required.
