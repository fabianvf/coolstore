## Reasoning

1. The first issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is because Java EE specifications have been migrated to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly. In Quarkus, we use the Jakarta EE packages.

2. The second issue again highlights the need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is consistent with the first reasoning.

3. The third issue suggests that in Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not required if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not using any specific features of the `InjectionPoint` class, so we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and the `InjectionPoint` parameter. Instead, we can use a `@Named` getter method to access the `log` field.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Instance;
import jakarta.inject.Named;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    @Named("producerLog")
    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    public Logger produceLog(Instance<Logger> loggers) {
        return loggers.get();
    }
}
```
In the updated file, we have replaced the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise`. We have also removed the `@Produces` annotation and the `InjectionPoint` parameter from the `produceLog` method. Instead, we have used a `@Named` annotation to give a name to the `log` field, and we have injected a `Instance<Logger>` parameter into the `produceLog` method. This allows us to get the logger instance using the `get()` method of the `Instance` class.

Note that we have not changed the file name or the package name, as there is no need to do so. However, if this class is part of a larger Java EE application that is being migrated to Quarkus, it may be necessary to move the class to a new package or to rename the package to follow Quarkus naming conventions. Additionally, if this class has external dependencies, it may be necessary to update the `pom.xml` file to use Quarkus-compatible versions of those dependencies.
