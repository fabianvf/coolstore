["1. The first step is to address the issues found by the static source code analysis. These issues are related to the import statements that need to be updated from `javax` to `jakarta` namespace. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace for its dependencies, following the Jakarta EE specification.\n\n2. We need to replace the following import statements:\n   - `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` with `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` (Issue 1)\n   - `javax.annotation.Resource` with `jakarta.annotation.Resource` (Issue 2)\n   - `javax.ejb.Singleton` with `jakarta.ejb.Singleton` (Issue 3)\n   - `javax.ejb.Startup` with `jakarta.ejb.Startup` (Issue 4)\n   - `javax.ejb.TransactionManagement` with `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement` (Issue 5)\n   - `javax.ejb.TransactionManagementType` with `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType` (Issue 6)\n   - `javax.inject.Inject` with `jakarta.inject.Inject` (Issue 7)\n\n3. After updating the import statements, we can see that the class `DataBaseMigrationStartup` is a Singleton EJB with a PostConstruct method that initializes and migrates the database using Flyway. Quarkus does not support EJBs, so we need to find an alternative solution for this functionality.\n\n4. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Startup` annotation from the `io.quarkus.arc.runtime.BeanCreator` package to replace the `@Startup` annotation from `javax.ejb`. This annotation ensures that the bean is initialized when the application starts.\n\n5. We can replace the `@Singleton` annotation with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation from `jakarta.enterprise.context`. This annotation ensures that the bean is created only once per application and its lifecycle is managed by the CDI container.\n\n6. Since Quarkus does not support EJBs, we need to remove the `@TransactionManagement` and `TransactionManagementType` annotations. Instead, we can use the `@Transactional` annotation from `io.quarkus.hibernate.transaction.Transactional` to manage transactions in a Quarkus-friendly way.\n\n7. We can replace the `javax.sql.DataSource` with `io.deploy.micrometer.api. MicrometerRegistry` to get the datasource.\n\n8. We need to add the following dependency in the `pom.xml` file to use Flyway in Quarkus:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```"]
