["1. The first step in migrating from Java EE to Quarkus is to update the import statements to use the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace. This is why we need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation` on lines 6 and 7.\n\n2. Similarly, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statements with `jakarta.ejb` on lines 8, 9, 10, and 11. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace.\n\n3. We also need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject` on line 12. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace.\n\n4. The `@Singleton` and `@Startup` annotations are not needed in Quarkus as it uses a different mechanism for managing application lifecycle. These annotations can be removed.\n\n5. The `@TransactionManagement` annotation is not needed in Quarkus as it uses a different mechanism for managing transactions. This annotation can be removed.\n\n6. The `javax.sql.DataSource` type is still used in Quarkus, so we can keep the `dataSource` field as is.\n\n7. The `@Resource` annotation is not needed in Quarkus as it uses a different mechanism for managing resources. This annotation can be removed.\n\n8. The `Flyway` class is still used in Quarkus, so we can keep the `startup` method as is."]
