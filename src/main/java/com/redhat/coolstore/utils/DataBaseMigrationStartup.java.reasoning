["1. The first issue to address is the import statements that are using the `javax` namespace. The Quarkus framework uses the `jakarta` namespace, so these import statements need to be updated accordingly. This is a simple find and replace operation that can be done in the code editor.\n\n2. The `@Singleton`, `@Startup`, `@TransactionManagement`, and `@Resource` annotations are from the `javax.ejb` package, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb`. These annotations are used to define the lifecycle and transaction management of the class. In Quarkus, these annotations are still valid and can be used in the same way.\n\n3. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies into the class. This annotation is from the `javax.inject` package, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n\n4. The `DataSource` class is used to get a reference to a database connection. This class is part of the Java EE API, but it is also available in Quarkus. Therefore, there is no need to change this class.\n\n5. The `Flyway` class is used to manage database migrations. This class is part of the Flyway library, which is a separate dependency that needs to be added to the Quarkus project. The Flyway library is available as a Quarkus extension, which can be added to the `pom.xml` file.\n\n6. The `QuarkusFlyway` class is used to integrate Flyway with Quarkus. This class is part of the Quarkus Flyway extension, which provides additional functionality for using Flyway in a Quarkus application.\n\n7. The `Log` class is used to log messages. This class is part of the Quarkus logging framework, which provides a simple and efficient way to log messages in a Quarkus application.\n\n8. The `startup()` method is annotated with `@PostConstruct`, which is used to indicate that this method should be called after the class has been constructed. This annotation is part of the Java EE API, but it is also available in Quarkus. Therefore, there is no need to change this annotation.\n\n9. The `startup()` method is used to initialize the database using Flyway. This method creates a new `QuarkusFlyway` instance, sets the data source, and then calls the `baseline()` and `migrate()` methods to initialize the database. This method is still valid in Quarkus and can be used in the same way."]
