["1. The first step is to address the issues found by the static source code analysis. These issues are related to the import statements that need to be updated from `javax` to `jakarta` namespace. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which is the evolution of the Java EE API.\n\n2. We need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation` in lines 6 and 7. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which includes the annotation package.\n\n3. We need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` in lines 8, 9, 10, and 11. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which includes the ejb package.\n\n4. We need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject` in line 12. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which includes the inject package.\n\n5. After updating the import statements, we can see that the class `DataBaseMigrationStartup` is a Singleton EJB that initializes and migrates the database using Flyway. However, Quarkus does not support EJBs. Instead, Quarkus uses the Arc dependency injection framework, which is built on CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java). Therefore, we need to refactor the class to use the Arc framework.\n\n6. We can start by removing the `@Singleton` and `@Startup` annotations, which are EJB annotations. Instead, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation from the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package to indicate that the bean is application-scoped.\n\n7. We can also remove the `@TransactionManagement` annotation, which is an EJB annotation. Instead, we can use the `@Transactional` annotation from the `io.quarkus.arc.transaction` package to indicate that the bean is transactional.\n\n8. We can replace the `@Resource` annotation with the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `DataSource` object. We can also remove the `mappedName` attribute, which is specific to EJBs.\n\n9. We can replace the `Flyway` class with the `QuarkusFlyway` class from the `io.quarkus.flyway` package. This class provides a convenient way to integrate Flyway with Quarkus.\n\n10. We can remove the `try-catch` block and instead use a method reference to handle exceptions. We can also remove the `logger` field and use the `@Log` annotation from the `jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi` package to inject a logger.\n\n11. We can also remove the `private` modifier from the `startup` method, which is not necessary in Quarkus."]
