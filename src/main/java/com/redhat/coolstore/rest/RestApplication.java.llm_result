## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in the latest versions. This renaming affects the `javax.ws.rs` package, which is now `jakarta.ws.rs`. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus, which is built on Jakarta EE.

2. **Issue 3 and 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary, and the root path can be set directly in the `Application` class. This means that the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not needed. However, since it does not cause any harm or conflict, we can leave it as is for backward compatibility.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/services")
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
```

## Additional Changes

Since we have not made any changes to the `pom.xml` file, there are no additional changes required. However, if there were any external dependencies or imports that needed to be updated, we would need to address them accordingly. In this case, since the code is minimal and self-contained, there are no such changes needed.
