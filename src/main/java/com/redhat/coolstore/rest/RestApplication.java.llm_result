## Reasoning

1. The `javax.ws.rs` package has been replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs` in Quarkus. Therefore, the import statement `import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;` should be updated to `import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;`.
2. The same change should be made to the import statement on line 4.
3. JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. The root path can be set if desired, but it is not required. Therefore, the comment indicating the need for JAX-RS activation can be removed.
4. The same change should be made to the comment on line 8.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/services")
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
```
