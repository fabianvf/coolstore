## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE code is using the `javax.ws.rs` package for importing JAX-RS classes. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ws.rs` package for JAX-RS classes. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws` import statements with `jakarta.ws` on lines 3 and 4.

2. **Issue 3 and 4:** JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to set the base URI for the JAX-RS application. In Quarkus, we can set a root path, but it is not necessary. Therefore, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath("/services")` annotation on lines 7 and 8.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

public class RestApplication extends Application {
}
```

Regarding the `pom.xml` file, we don't need to make any changes since we are not adding or removing any external dependencies. However, if there were any dependencies related to JAX-RS, we would need to remove them.

Regarding imports, we only need to update the `jakarta.ws.rs` package import, which we have already done in the updated file.
