## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE specification has been renamed to Jakarta EE in version 9, which includes a change in package names from `javax` to `jakarta`. Quarkus is built on Jakarta EE 8, so we need to update our import statements accordingly. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

2. **Issue 3 and 4:** JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different approach for setting up the application context. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to set the root path for the JAX-RS application, but in Quarkus, it is not required. We can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the root path will still work as expected.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

public class RestApplication extends Application {
}
```

In the updated file, we have removed the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and changed the import statements to use `jakarta.ws` instead of `javax.ws`. This ensures compatibility with Quarkus and simplifies the code.
