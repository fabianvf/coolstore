## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in order to avoid trademark issues with Oracle. The `javax` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta` in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. This change is required in the import statements on lines 3 and 4.

2. **Issue 3 and 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to define the base URI for the JAX-RS application. However, Quarkus uses a different approach for configuring the root path. Instead of using `@ApplicationPath`, we can define the root path in the `application.properties` file. Since Quarkus automatically registers JAX-RS resources, we don't need to extend the `Application` class.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

// No import statements needed for JAX-RS activation

// No need to extend Application class

// Define the root path in application.properties file
// quarkus.rest.path=/services
```

## Additional Information

1. In Quarkus, we don't need to define a JAX-RS application class. Instead, Quarkus automatically registers all JAX-RS resources and providers.

2. To define the root path in Quarkus, we can use the `quarkus.rest.path` configuration property in the `application.properties` file.

3. Make sure to remove the `pom.xml` dependencies related to JAX-RS activation, such as `jersery-server` or `cxf-rt-frontend-jaxrs`.

4. If you have any other Java EE dependencies in your `pom.xml` file, you may need to replace them with Quarkus extensions. You can find the list of available Quarkus extensions in the Quarkus documentation.

5. If you have any other Java EE annotations in your code, you may need to replace them with Quarkus alternatives. Again, you can find the list of available Quarkus alternatives in the Quarkus documentation.
