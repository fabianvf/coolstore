## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 to Issue 8**: The Java EE API packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. This means that the `javax` package names have been changed to `jakarta`. In this case, all the `javax` imports need to be changed to `jakarta`. This includes `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`, `javax.inject.Inject`, `javax.ws.rs.Consumes`, `javax.ws.rs.GET`, `javax.ws.rs.Path`, `javax.ws.rs.PathParam`, `javax.ws.rs.Produces`, `javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType`, and `javax.ws.rs.core.Response`. They need to be changed to `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`, `jakarta.inject.Inject`, `jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes`, `jakarta.ws.rs.GET`, `jakarta.ws.rs.Path`, `jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam`, `jakarta.ws.rs.Produces`, `jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType`, and `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response` respectively.

2. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is used to indicate that a bean is request-scoped, meaning that a new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request. This annotation is part of the Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) specification, which is a part of Jakarta EE. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@ApplicationScoped`, which indicates that a single instance of the bean is created for the duration of the application. However, since the behavior of `@RequestScoped` is not explicitly defined in the provided code, we can assume that it is used to indicate a new instance per HTTP request, and thus, we can replace it with `@RequestScoped` from `jakarta.enterprise.context`.

3. The `OrderService` class is injected using the `@Inject` annotation. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@Inject` from `jakarta.inject`.

4. The `OrderEndpoint` class is annotated with `@Path` to indicate that it is a REST endpoint. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@Path` from `jakarta.ws.rs`.

5. The `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations are used to indicate the media types that the endpoint can consume and produce, respectively. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotations are `@Consumes` and `@Produces` from `jakarta.ws.rs`.

6. The `Order` class is imported using the `import` statement. In Quarkus, the equivalent import statement is `import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;`.

7. The `OrderService` class is injected using the `@Inject` annotation. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@Inject` from `jakarta.inject`.

8. The `listAll` and `getOrder` methods are annotated with `@GET` to indicate that they are HTTP GET methods. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@GET` from `jakarta.ws.rs`.

9. The `@Path` annotation is used to indicate the path of the endpoint. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@Path` from `jakarta.ws.rs`.

10. The `@PathParam` annotation is used to indicate that the `orderId` parameter is a path parameter. In Quarkus, the equivalent annotation is `@PathParam` from `jakarta.ws.rs`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import java.util.List;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.service.OrderService;

@RequestScoped
@Path("/orders")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class OrderEndpoint implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -7227732980791688774L;

    @Inject
    private OrderService os;

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    public List<Order> listAll() {
        return os.getOrders();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{orderId}")
    public Order getOrder(@PathParam("orderId") long orderId) {
        return os.getOrderById(orderId);
    }

}
```

Note: The above code is written for Quarkus and uses the `jakarta` package names instead of `javax`. However, it is important to note that the behavior of the code may differ from the original Java EE code, as some of the annotations and classes may have different behavior in Quarkus. It is recommended to thoroughly test the code to ensure that it meets the desired requirements.
