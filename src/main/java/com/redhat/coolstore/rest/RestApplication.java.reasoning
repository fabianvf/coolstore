["1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE specification has been renamed to Jakarta EE in version 9, which includes a change in package names from `javax` to `jakarta`. Quarkus is built on Jakarta EE 8, so we need to update our import statements accordingly. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Issue 3 and 4:** JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different approach for setting up the application context. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to set the root path for the JAX-RS application, but in Quarkus, it is not required. We can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the root path will still work as expected."]
