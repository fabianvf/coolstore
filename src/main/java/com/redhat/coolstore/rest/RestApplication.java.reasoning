["1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE code is using the `javax.ws.rs` package for importing JAX-RS classes. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ws.rs` package for JAX-RS classes. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws` import statements with `jakarta.ws` on lines 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Issue 3 and 4:** JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is used to set the base URI for the JAX-RS application. In Quarkus, we can set a root path, but it is not necessary. Therefore, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath(\"/services\")` annotation on lines 7 and 8."]
