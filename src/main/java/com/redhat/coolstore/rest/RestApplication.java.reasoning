["1. **Issue 1 and Issue 2**: The Java EE APIs have been rebranded under the Jakarta EE umbrella. This includes the JAX-RS API which is used in this file for RESTful web services. The import statements need to be updated from `javax.ws` to `jakarta.ws` to reflect this change.\n\n2. **Issue 3 and Issue 4**: In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is not necessary as Quarkus automatically registers JAX-RS resources and providers. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is also not needed as Quarkus provides a default root path (\"/\") for all REST endpoints. However, if a different root path is desired, it can be set using the `quarkus.resteasy.path` property in the `application.properties` file."]
