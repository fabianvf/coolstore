["1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in the latest versions. This renaming affects the `javax.ws.rs` package, which is now `jakarta.ws.rs`. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus, which is built on Jakarta EE.\n\n2. **Issue 3 and 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary, and the root path can be set directly in the `Application` class. This means that the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not needed. However, since it does not cause any harm or conflict, we can leave it as is for backward compatibility."]
