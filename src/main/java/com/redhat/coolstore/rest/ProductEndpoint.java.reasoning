["1. **Addressing Issue 1:** The first issue suggests replacing the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Addressing Issue 2:** The second issue suggests replacing the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is also required due to the move from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace.\n\n3. **Addressing Issue 3:** The third issue suggests replacing the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`. This change is required for the same reason as Issues 1 and 2.\n\n4. **No changes to the pom.xml:** The provided information does not indicate any changes are needed in the pom.xml.\n\n5. **No changes to imports:** The provided information does not indicate any changes are needed for the other imports."]
