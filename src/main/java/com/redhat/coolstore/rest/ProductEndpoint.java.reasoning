["1. **Addressing Issue 1:** The first issue to address is the import statement for `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`. This import statement needs to be updated to `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` to be compatible with Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which is a successor to Java EE. The package names have been changed from `javax` to `jakarta` in Jakarta EE.\n\n2. **Addressing Issue 2:** The second issue to address is the import statement for `javax.inject.Inject`. This import statement needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject.Inject` to be compatible with Quarkus. This is similar to Issue 1, where the package names have been changed from `javax` to `jakarta` in Jakarta EE.\n\n3. **Addressing Issue 3:** The third issue to address is the import statement for `javax.ws.rs.*`. This import statement needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.*` to be compatible with Quarkus. Again, this is due to the package name change from `javax` to `jakarta` in Jakarta EE.\n\n4. **External Dependencies and Imports:** There are no external dependencies in the provided code, so there is no need to update the `pom.xml` file. However, the imports for `com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product` and `com.redhat.coolstore.service.ProductService` need to be checked. If these packages are not present in the Quarkus project, they need to be added as dependencies in the `pom.xml` file."]
