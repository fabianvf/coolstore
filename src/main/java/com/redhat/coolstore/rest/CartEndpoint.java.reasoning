["1. **Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`**: This change is required as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. The `javax` namespace is used in Java EE, while Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace. This change is necessary for the `@SessionScoped` annotation.\n\n2. **Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`**: Similar to the first step, this change is required due to the switch from the `javax` namespace in Java EE to the `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus. This change is necessary for the `@Inject` annotation.\n\n3. **Replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`**: This change is required due to the switch from the `javax` namespace in Java EE to the `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus. This change is necessary for the `@Path`, `@PathParam`, `@Produces`, and `@Consumes` annotations.\n\n4. **Replace CDI `@SessionScoped` with `@RequestScoped`**: Quarkus does not support `@SessionScoped` directly. Instead, it uses ArC, a lightweight CDI implementation. ArC supports `@ApplicationScoped`, `@Singleton`, and `@RequestScoped`. In this case, `@RequestScoped` is the most appropriate scope.\n\n5. **Remove `implements Serializable`**: Quarkus uses RESTEasy Reactive, which does not require the use of `Serializable`.\n\n6. **Remove `javax.jms` imports**: The provided code does not use JMS, so these imports can be safely removed."]
