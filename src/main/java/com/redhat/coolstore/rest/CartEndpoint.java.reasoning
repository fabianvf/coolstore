["1. **Step 1:** Address the import issues. The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in Quarkus. This means that all the `javax` imports need to be changed to `jakarta` imports. This is why we need to replace `javax.enterprise`, `javax.inject`, `javax.ws.rs` imports with their equivalent `jakarta` imports.\n\n2. **Step 2:** Replace the `@SessionScoped` annotation with `@RequestScoped`. Quarkus does not support `@SessionScoped` directly. Instead, it uses `@RequestScoped` for HTTP request-level state. If session-level state is required, it can be implemented using a `@Singleton` bean with an `ConcurrentHashMap` to store state per session.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Remove the `Serializable` interface. Quarkus REST endpoints do not need to be serializable as they are not stored in a session.\n\n4. **Step 4:** Replace the `ShoppingCartService` with a Quarkus-compatible dependency injection. This can be done by using the `@Inject` annotation on a constructor and marking the `ShoppingCartService` as a `@ApplicationScoped` bean.\n\n5. **Step 5:** Remove the `Produces` annotation. Quarkus automatically sets the response media type to `application/json` for all REST endpoints."]
