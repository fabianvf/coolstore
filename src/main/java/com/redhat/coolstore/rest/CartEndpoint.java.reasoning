["1. **Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API instead of the Java EE API. The `javax` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta` in Jakarta EE, starting with version 8.\n\n2. **Replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`**: Similar to the first step, this change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API instead of the Java EE API. The `javax` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta` in Jakarta EE, starting with version 8.\n\n3. **Replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API instead of the Java EE API. The `javax` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta` in Jakarta EE, starting with version 8. This change needs to be done for all the `javax.ws` import statements.\n\n4. **Change `@SessionScoped` to `@RequestScoped`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses a different concept for managing the lifecycle of beans. Quarkus uses a more lightweight approach with the `@RequestScoped` annotation, which is more suitable for a microservices architecture."]
