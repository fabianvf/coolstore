["1. **Issue 1:** The first issue to address is the import statement that uses `javax.enterprise`. This needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` as Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API. This change is required because Quarkus is built on top of the Jakarta EE API, and the `javax` namespace is deprecated in favor of `jakarta`.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The second issue is the import statement that uses `javax.inject`. This needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` for the same reason as in Issue 1.\n\n3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:** These issues are similar to the first two issues. The import statements that use `javax.ws.rs` need to be replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs`. This change is required because Quarkus is built on top of the Jakarta EE API, and the `javax` namespace is deprecated in favor of `jakarta`.\n\n4. **JMSDestinationDefinitions:** The annotation `@JMSDestinationDefinitions` is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses MicroProfile Config for configuration. Therefore, this annotation needs to be removed.\n\n5. **SessionScoped:** The annotation `@SessionScoped` is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses a different concept of scopes. The `@RequestScoped` annotation should be used instead.\n\n6. **Serializable:** Quarkus does not require the `Serializable` interface to be implemented for Java beans. Therefore, this can be removed."]
