## Reasoning

1. **Addressing Issue 1:** The first issue to address is the import statement for `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`. This needs to be updated to `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` to comply with Quarkus standards. The reason for this change is that Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the older Java EE namespace.

2. **Addressing Issue 2:** The second issue to address is the import statement for `javax.inject.Inject`. This needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject.Inject` to comply with Quarkus standards. The reason for this change is the same as in step 1.

3. **Addressing Issue 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:** These issues pertain to the import statements for `javax.ws.rs.*`. These need to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.*` to comply with Quarkus standards. The reason for this change is the same as in step 1.

4. **Addressing the class `OrderService`:** The `OrderService` class needs to be checked if it is a third-party dependency or a custom class. If it is a third-party dependency, it needs to be checked if a Quarkus-compatible version exists. If it is a custom class, it needs to be checked if it can be replaced with a Quarkus-native alternative or if it needs to be updated to comply with Quarkus standards.

5. **Addressing the package `com.redhat.coolstore.rest`:** The package structure needs to be checked if it complies with the Quarkus standards. If not, it needs to be updated.

6. **Addressing the annotations `@RequestScoped`, `@Path`, `@Consumes`, `@Produces`:** These annotations need to be checked if they are from the Jakarta EE namespace or if they need to be replaced with Quarkus-native alternatives.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import java.util.List;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.service.OrderService;

@RequestScoped
@Path("/orders")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class OrderEndpoint implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -7227732980791688774L;

    @Inject
    private OrderService os;

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    public List<Order> listAll() {
        return os.getOrders();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{orderId}")
    public Order getOrder(@PathParam("orderId") long orderId) {
        return os.getOrderById(orderId);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

The updated file does not include changes to the `OrderService` class as it is not provided in the input information. If `OrderService` is a custom class, it needs to be checked if it can be replaced with a Quarkus-native alternative or if it needs to be updated to comply with Quarkus standards. If `OrderService` is a third-party dependency, it needs to be checked if a Quarkus-compatible version exists.
