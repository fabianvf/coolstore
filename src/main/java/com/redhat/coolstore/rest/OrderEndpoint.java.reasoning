["1. The first step in migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found in the static code analysis. The primary issue to address is replacing the `javax.enterprise`, `javax.inject`, and `javax.ws.rs` import statements with their corresponding `jakarta.enterprise`, `jakarta.inject`, and `jakarta.ws` equivalents.\n\n2. The reason for this change is that Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace for its APIs, which is a result of the transfer of Java EE technologies to the Eclipse Foundation. The `javax` namespace is still used in Java EE, and therefore, there is a conflict.\n\n3. To update the import statements, we need to replace all instances of `javax` with `jakarta`. For example, `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` should be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`.\n\n4. After updating the import statements, we need to ensure that there are no conflicts with external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. In this case, there are no external dependencies that need to be updated.\n\n5. Finally, we need to ensure that there are no impacts on imports that are not part of the migration. In this case, the import statement `import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;` and `import com.redhat.coolstore.service.OrderService;` are not part of the migration and do not need to be updated."]
