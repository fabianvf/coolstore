["1. The first step in migrating Java EE code to Quarkus is to update the import statements to use the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace.\n\n2. The `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`. This annotation is used to specify the scope of the CDI managed bean, in this case, the scope is request-level. Quarkus uses the same concept of CDI, but the package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace.\n\n3. The `javax.inject.Inject` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject.Inject`. This annotation is used to inject dependencies into a CDI managed bean. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus.\n\n4. The `javax.ws.rs.Consumes` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes`. This annotation is used to specify the MIME media types of the request entity body that the resource can process. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus.\n\n5. The `javax.ws.rs.GET` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.GET`. This annotation is used to specify the HTTP GET request method. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus.\n\n6. The `javax.ws.rs.Path` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.Path`. This annotation is used to specify the path to the resource. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus.\n\n7. The `javax.ws.rs.PathParam` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.PathParam`. This annotation is used to map a method parameter to a template parameter in the path annotation. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus.\n\n8. The `javax.ws.rs.Produces` annotation needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.Produces`. This annotation is used to specify the MIME media types of the response entity body that the resource can produce. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus.\n\n9. The `javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType` class needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType`. This class is used to specify the MIME media type of the request or response entity body. The package has been migrated to `jakarta` namespace in Quarkus."]
