## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE specification has been migrated to the Jakarta EE specification, which means that the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change needs to be reflected in the import statements on lines 3 and 4.

2. **Issue 3 & 4:** Similar to issue 1 and 2, the package names have changed from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`. This change needs to be reflected in the import statements on lines 5 and 6.

3. **Issue 5:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed for injecting an `EntityManager`. Instead, Quarkus creates the bean automatically when the datasource is correctly configured. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation should be removed from the `EntityManager` on line 5.

4. **Issue 6:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed when the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, a `@Named` getter method can be used instead of the field. Therefore, the `@Named` annotation should be moved from the getter method to the field on line 14.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;

@Dependent
public class Resources {

    @Inject
    private EntityManager em;

    @Named
    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {
        return em;
    }
}
```

Note that the changes made in this migration are minimal, as the original JavaEE code was already using the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `EntityManager`. Therefore, the main changes made were to update the import statements to use the `jakarta` package names instead of the `javax` package names.
