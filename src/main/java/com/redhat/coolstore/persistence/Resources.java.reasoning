["1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in the latest versions. The `javax` package has been replaced by `jakarta` package. So, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n\n2. **Issue 3 & 4:** Similar to Issue 1 & 2, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n3. **Issue 5:** In Quarkus, we don't need to manually produce the `EntityManager` as it will be automatically created by Quarkus after correctly setting up the datasource. So, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and use `@Inject` instead.\n\n4. **Issue 6:** In Quarkus, if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation. Here, we can use `@Dependent` as a scope annotation. Also, we can use `@Named` to get the `EntityManager`.", "1. **Issue 1 & 2**: The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in the latest versions.
