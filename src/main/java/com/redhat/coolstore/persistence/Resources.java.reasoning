["1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE specification has been migrated to the Jakarta EE specification, which means that the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change needs to be reflected in the import statements on lines 3 and 4.\n\n2. **Issue 3 & 4:** Similar to issue 1 and 2, the package names have changed from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`. This change needs to be reflected in the import statements on lines 5 and 6.\n\n3. **Issue 5:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed for injecting an `EntityManager`. Instead, Quarkus creates the bean automatically when the datasource is correctly configured. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation should be removed from the `EntityManager` on line 5.\n\n4. **Issue 6:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed when the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, a `@Named` getter method can be used instead of the field. Therefore, the `@Named` annotation should be moved from the getter method to the field on line 14."]
