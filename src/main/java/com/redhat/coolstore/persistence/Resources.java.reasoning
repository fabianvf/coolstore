["1. Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n\n2. Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n3. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus. If you are using a `@Produces` annotation for your EntityManager, and it is not needed after configuring your datasource, remove it and `@Inject` the EntityManager. Otherwise, if the producer is still needed, please create a qualification for your produced `EntityManager`, as well as every injection point for the EM.\n\n4. In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead."]
