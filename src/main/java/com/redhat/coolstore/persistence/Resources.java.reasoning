["1. The first four issues are related to import statements. In Quarkus, the `javax` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta`. This is a breaking change introduced in Jakarta EE 9, which Quarkus has adopted. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax` imports with `jakarta` imports.\n\n2. Regarding Issue 5, in Java EE/Jakarta EE, we use `@PersistenceContext` to inject a data source. However, in Quarkus, a data source is automatically created by correctly setting up the datasource configuration. Since the `@Produces` annotation is not needed after configuring the datasource, we can remove it and directly inject the `EntityManager`.\n\n3. Issue 6 is related to the `@Named` annotation used on the getter method for the `EntityManager`. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Since the `@Named` annotation is a qualifier, we can use it to access the `EntityManager` directly."]
