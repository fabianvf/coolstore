["1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static analysis. The input file contains import statements from the `javax` package, but Quarkus uses the `jakarta` package. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax` import statements with `jakarta` ones.\n\n2. Regarding Issue 5, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed in Quarkus if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, the `EntityManager` is automatically created by Quarkus, so we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and use `@Inject` instead.\n\n3. Regarding Issue 6, we can use a `@Named` getter method to access the `EntityManager` instead of using the `@Produces` annotation.\n\n4. We also need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies related to Java EE and add the Quarkus dependencies."]
