["1. The first step in migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found in the static source code analysis. The primary issue to address is replacing the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved the `javax.persistence` package to `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n2. To replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`, we need to update the following import statements:\n\n* `javax.persistence.Column` to `jakarta.persistence.Column`\n* `javax.persistence.Entity` to `jakarta.persistence.Entity`\n* `javax.persistence.Id` to `jakarta.persistence.Id`\n* `javax.persistence.Table` to `jakarta.persistence.Table`\n* `javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint` to `jakarta.persistence.UniqueConstraint`\n* `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` to `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement`\n\n3. These changes are necessary to ensure that the code is compatible with Quarkus and uses the Jakarta EE API.\n\n4. There are no external dependencies in the pom.xml file that need to be updated, and there are no changes to imports required beyond the ones mentioned above."]
