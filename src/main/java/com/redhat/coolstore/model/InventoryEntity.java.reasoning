["1. The first step in migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found from static analysis. The primary issue to address is replacing the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace.\n\n2. The `javax.persistence` package is used for Java Persistence API (JPA) annotations in JavaEE. In Quarkus, the equivalent package is `jakarta.persistence`. Therefore, we need to replace all instances of `javax.persistence` with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n3. The `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` annotation is used to indicate that a Java class is a root element of an XML document. In Quarkus, the equivalent package is `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement`. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` annotation with `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement`.\n\n4. After making these changes, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies that are no longer needed and add any new dependencies required by Quarkus."]
