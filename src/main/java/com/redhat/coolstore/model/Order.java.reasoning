["1. The first step in migrating Java EE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found in the static code analysis. In this case, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved the persistence-related classes from the `javax.persistence` package to the `jakarta.persistence` package.\n\n2. Starting from line 7 to line 15, we need to replace all the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary to ensure that the code uses the correct package for persistence-related classes.\n\n3. The changes to the imports do not affect the external dependencies in the pom.xml file. However, we may need to update the dependencies in the pom.xml file to use the Quarkus versions of the libraries.\n\n4. The changes to the imports do not affect the imports in the file. However, we may need to update the imports in other files to use the `jakarta.persistence` package."]
