["1. The first step in migrating Java EE code to Quarkus is to analyze the existing code and identify any dependencies that need to be replaced or updated. In this case, we are using the `quarkus-jakarta-persistence-api` and `quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache` dependencies, which are the Quarkus equivalents of the Java EE `javax.persistence` package.\n\n2. The next step is to address the issues found in the static source code analysis. In this case, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence` import statements. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace.\n\n3. We need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies that are no longer needed in Quarkus. In this case, we don't need to remove any dependencies, as the `quarkus-jakarta-persistence-api` and `quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache` dependencies are sufficient for using the `jakarta.persistence` package.\n\n4. We also need to update the imports in the `OrderItem.java` file to use the `jakarta.persistence` package instead of the `javax.persistence` package. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace."]
