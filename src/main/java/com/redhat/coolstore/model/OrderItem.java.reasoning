["1. The first step in migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus is to address the issues found in the static source code analysis. The primary issue to address is replacing the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved the persistence package to `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n2. To replace the `javax.persistence` import statements, we need to update the following import statements:\n\n   - `javax.persistence.Column` to `jakarta.persistence.Column`\n   - `javax.persistence.Entity` to `jakarta.persistence.Entity`\n   - `javax.persistence.GeneratedValue` to `jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue`\n   - `javax.persistence.Id` to `jakarta.persistence.Id`\n   - `javax.persistence.Table` to `jakarta.persistence.Table`\n\n3. After updating the import statements, there are no further changes required for the `OrderItem` class. The class uses the JPA annotations to define an entity, and these annotations are still valid in Quarkus.\n\n4. There are no external dependencies to update in the `pom.xml` file, as the `OrderItem` class does not have any dependencies.\n\n5. The updated `OrderItem` class is compatible with Quarkus and can be used in a Quarkus application."]
