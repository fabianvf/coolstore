["1. The first step is to address the issue found from static analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is required because Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the package names have been changed accordingly. Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, so we need to use the Jakarta EE package names.\n\n2. We also need to check if there are any other Java EE dependencies in the `pom.xml` file and update them to their Jakarta EE equivalents. This step is important because Quarkus may not be compatible with Java EE dependencies, and we need to ensure that our application is using Jakarta EE dependencies that are compatible with Quarkus.\n\n3. We need to check if there are any Quarkus-specific annotations or configurations that need to be added to the `ShoppingCart` class. Quarkus has its own set of annotations and configurations that are used to configure the application, and we need to ensure that our `ShoppingCart` class is using the correct annotations and configurations.\n\n4. We need to check if there are any Quarkus-specific features that we can use to improve the performance or functionality of our `ShoppingCart` class. Quarkus has a number of features that can improve the performance and functionality of our application, and we need to ensure that we are using them to their fullest extent."]
