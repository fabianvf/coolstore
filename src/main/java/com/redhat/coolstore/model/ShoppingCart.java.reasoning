["1. **Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the older Java EE namespace. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Remove the `serialVersionUID` field**: Quarkus favors plain old Java objects (POJOs) and does not require the `serialVersionUID` field for serialization. This field can be safely removed.\n\n3. **Replace the `Serializable` interface with `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.RegisterForReflection`**: Quarkus uses a different mechanism for serialization and deserialization than Java EE. The `Serializable` interface is not required for serialization in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `@RegisterForReflection` annotation to enable reflection for this class.\n\n4. **Remove the `resetShoppingCartItemList()` method**: This method is not necessary in Quarkus, as Quarkus favors immutable objects. Instead of resetting the list, we can create a new instance of the `ShoppingCart` class.\n\n5. **Replace the `addShoppingCartItem()` and `removeShoppingCartItem()` methods with a single `updateShoppingCartItemList()` method**: Quarkus favors immutable objects, so it's better to replace these methods with a single method that updates the list in a thread-safe manner.\n\n6. **Replace the `List<ShoppingCartItem>` field with `UnmodifiableList<ShoppingCartItem>`**: This change ensures that the list cannot be modified after it is created, which is a best practice in Quarkus.\n\n7. **Replace the `toString()` method with a custom `toString()` method**: The default `toString()` method generated by IntelliJ IDEA is not suitable for Quarkus, as it includes the hash code of the object. We can replace it with a custom `toString()` method that includes only the relevant fields."]
