["1. The first issue highlights the need to update the import statement from `javax.ejb` to `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is required for the `@Stateless` annotation.\n\n2. The second issue indicates that we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because, like the `javax` package, Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`.\n\n3. The third issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because, like the `javax` package, Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`.\n\n4. The fourth issue is a continuation of the previous issues, requiring us to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n5. The fifth issue is a continuation of the previous issues, requiring us to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n6. The sixth issue is a continuation of the previous issues, requiring us to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n7. The seventh issue highlights the need to remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` and inject it directly. This change is necessary because Quarkus automatically creates the bean when the datasource is correctly configured. However, if the producer is still needed, we should create a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM.\n\n8. The eighth issue indicates that we need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, and `@ApplicationScoped` is the equivalent of `@Stateless` in Quarkus."]
