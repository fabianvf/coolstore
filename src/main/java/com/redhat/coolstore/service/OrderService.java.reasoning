["1. To migrate the `OrderService` from Java EE to Quarkus, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. Similarly, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n3. The `@Stateless` annotation should be replaced with a scope such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n4. In Java EE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. However, in Quarkus, the bean is automatically created by correctly setting up the datasource. Therefore, using a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` is illegal in Quarkus.\n5. If a `@Produces` annotation for the `EntityManager` is used and it is not needed after configuring the datasource, it should be removed and the `@Inject` annotation should be used instead.\n6. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` should be created, as well as every injection point for the EM."]
