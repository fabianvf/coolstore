["1. The first issue highlights the need to replace `javax.ejb` import statements with `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API and not the older Java EE API. The `javax.ejb` package is part of the Java EE API, while `jakarta.ejb` is the equivalent package in the Jakarta EE API.\n\n2. The second issue highlights the need to replace `javax.inject` import statements with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, and the `javax.inject` package is part of the older Java EE API.\n\n3. The third issue highlights the need to replace `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, and the `javax.persistence` package is part of the older Java EE API.\n\n4. The fourth issue highlights the need to remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` and inject it instead. This change is necessary because Quarkus automatically creates the `EntityManager` bean when the datasource is correctly configured. Therefore, there is no need for a `@Produces` annotation.\n\n5. The fifth issue highlights the need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, and `@ApplicationScoped` is the equivalent scope annotation in Quarkus."]
