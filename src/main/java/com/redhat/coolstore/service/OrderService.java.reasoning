["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus. This is a result of the transfer of Java EE technologies to the Eclipse Foundation and the subsequent name change to Jakarta EE. The `@Stateless` annotation is part of the EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) specification, which has been moved to the `jakarta.ejb` package in Jakarta EE.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection and is part of the JSR-330 specification, which has been moved to the `jakarta.inject` package in Jakarta EE.\n\n3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:** The `javax.persistence` package has been replaced by `jakarta.persistence` in Quarkus. The JPA (Java Persistence API) specification, which includes classes such as `EntityManager`, `CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery`, and `Root`, has been moved to the `jakarta.persistence` package in Jakarta EE.\n\n4. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed for injecting an `EntityManager` when a datasource has been correctly configured. The `@Inject` annotation is sufficient. However, if the `@Produces` annotation is still needed, a qualifier should be created and used to differentiate between different `EntityManager` instances.\n\n5. **Issue 8:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, and the `@Stateless` annotation is not recognized in Quarkus."]
