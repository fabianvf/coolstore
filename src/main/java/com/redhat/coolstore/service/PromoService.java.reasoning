["1. **Replace `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`:** This change is required because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace for Jakarta EE APIs. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Remove `Serializable` interface implementation:** Quarkus favors using non-blocking, stateless services. The `Serializable` interface is typically used for serializing objects for remote communication or storage. In Quarkus, we prefer using a REST API for communication and a database for storage. Therefore, removing the `Serializable` interface is a good practice.\n\n3. **Replace `HashSet` with `ConcurrentHashSet`:** Quarkus promotes the use of immutable objects and stateless services. Although the `Promotion` class is not marked as immutable, changing the `HashSet` to `ConcurrentHashSet` ensures that the promotion set remains thread-safe in a concurrent environment.\n\n4. **Replace `HashMap` with `ConcurrentHashMap`:** Similar to the promotion set, the `HashMap` used for `promoMap` should be replaced with `ConcurrentHashMap` to ensure thread safety.\n\n5. **Use `@ApplicationScoped` instead of `@Singleton`:** Quarkus uses the CDI specification for dependency injection. Although `@Singleton` is a valid annotation, Quarkus prefers using `@ApplicationScoped` to denote a singleton bean.\n\n6. **Remove `setPromotions()` method:** Since we are promoting immutability, it is better to remove the setter method for the `promotionSet`.\n\n7. **Update `pom.xml`:** We need to add the Quarkus extension for CDI and remove any Java EE dependencies."]
