["1. **Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`:**\n   The Java EE API has been renamed to Jakarta EE, and this includes the enterprise context package. This is a straightforward change to make, and it ensures that the code uses the correct package for the Jakarta EE API.\n\n2. **Remove the `serialVersionUID` field:**\n   Quarkus uses a different serialization mechanism than Java EE, so the `serialVersionUID` field is not needed. This field is used for Java object serialization, and it is not required for Quarkus.\n\n3. **Remove the `toString()` method:**\n   The `toString()` method is not needed for Quarkus, and it can be removed. This method is used for debugging purposes, and it is not required for Quarkus.\n\n4. **Remove the `private` access modifier for the `name` field:**\n   Quarkus uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for dependency injection, and the `private` access modifier is not needed for the `name` field. This field can be removed or made `public`.\n\n5. **Remove the `getPromotions()` method:**\n   Quarkus uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for dependency injection, and the `getPromotions()` method is not needed. This method can be removed.\n\n6. **Remove the `promotionSet` field:**\n   Quarkus uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for dependency injection, and the `promotionSet` field is not needed. This field can be removed.\n\n7. **Remove the `PromoService` constructor:**\n   Quarkus uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for dependency injection, and the `PromoService` constructor is not needed. This constructor can be removed."]
