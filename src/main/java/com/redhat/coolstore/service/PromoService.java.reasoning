["1. The first step is to address the issue found from static analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` namespace used in Java EE.\n\n2. The `Serializable` interface is not needed in Quarkus as it does not require objects to be serialized when they are passed between JVMs. Therefore, we can remove the `Serializable` import statement and the `implements Serializable` clause.\n\n3. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is still needed in Quarkus to indicate that the `PromoService` is an application-scoped CDI bean. However, we need to ensure that the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package is imported instead of the `javax.enterprise.context` package.\n\n4. The `HashSet` and `HashMap` classes are still available in Quarkus, so we can keep using them. However, we need to ensure that the correct package is imported.\n\n5. The `Promotion` and `ShoppingCart` classes are not provided in the input file, so we assume that they are available in the Quarkus project. If they are not, we need to ensure that they are added to the project.\n\n6. The `getPromotions()` method is not needed in Quarkus as we can use a dependency injection framework to inject the `Set<Promotion>` into the `PromoService` constructor. Therefore, we can remove the `getPromotions()` and `setPromotions()` methods.\n\n7. The `toString()` method is not needed in Quarkus as it is used for debugging purposes only. Therefore, we can remove the `toString()` method."]
