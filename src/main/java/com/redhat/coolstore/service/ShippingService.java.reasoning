["1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The import statements for `javax.ejb` need to be updated to `jakarta.ejb` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Jakarta EE has changed its package names from `javax` to `jakarta` in its latest versions.\n\n2. **Issue 3:** The `@Remote` annotation is used in Java EE to indicate that a bean can be accessed remotely. However, Quarkus does not support Remote EJBs. Instead, we can replace the `@Remote` annotation with a `@Path` annotation to create a REST endpoint. We also need to remove the `@Stateless` annotation as REST services are stateless by nature. For each public method, we need to add `@GET` and `@Path` annotations to specify the HTTP method and endpoint path respectively.\n\n3. **Issue 4:** The `@Stateless` annotation is used in Java EE to indicate that a bean is a stateless session bean. However, Quarkus does not support EJBs. Instead, we can replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped` to indicate the lifecycle of the bean."]
