["1. **Issue 1 & 2**: The `javax.ejb` package is no longer used in Quarkus, it has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb`. Therefore, we need to replace the import statements on lines 6 and 7 with `import jakarta.ejb.Remote;` and `import jakarta.ejb.Stateless;` respectively.\n\n2. **Issue 3**: Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use REST functionality to expose our services. This involves a few steps:\n   - Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with `@Path(\"<endpoint>\")`. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.\n   - Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.\n   - For every public method on the EJB being converted, we need to annotate the method with `@GET` and `@Path(\"<endpoint>\")`. We also need to add `@QueryParam(\"<param-name>\")` to any method parameters if needed. However, in this case, there are no method parameters.\n\n3. **Issue 4**: Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\nHowever, since this class does not have any state and all methods are stateless, we can simply remove the `@Stateless` annotation as it is not necessary.\n\nAlso, since we are moving to a RESTful service, we need to change the return type of our methods from `double` to `Response` (or a specific subtype like `Response.ok(<value>)`).", "1. **Issue 1 & 2**: The `javax.ejb` package is not used in Quarkus, instead the `jakarta.ejb` package is used.
