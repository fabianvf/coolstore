["1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The import statements for `javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` and `jakarta.ws.rs.GET` are correct and do not need to be changed. However, the import statements for `javax.ejb.Stateless` and `javax.ejb.Remote` are incorrect for Quarkus. They need to be replaced with the equivalent `jakarta` packages. Since this class is not an EJB in Quarkus, we can remove the `@Stateless` annotation and replace it with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. The `@Remote` annotation is not needed in Quarkus as it does not support remote EJBs. Instead, we will convert the EJB to a REST service using the `@Path` and `@GET` annotations.\n\n2. **Issue 3:** To convert the EJB to a REST service, we need to remove the `@Stateless` annotation and add the `@Path` annotation to the class with an endpoint. We will also add the `@GET` annotation to the methods that calculate shipping and shipping insurance. Since these methods take a `ShoppingCart` parameter, we will add the `@QueryParam` annotation to the method parameter to indicate that it is a query parameter in the REST service.\n\n3. **Issue 4:** Since this class is not an EJB in Quarkus, we can remove the `@Stateless` annotation and replace it with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`."]
