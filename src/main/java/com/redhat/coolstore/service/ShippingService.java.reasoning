["1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The `javax.ejb` package is used in Java EE for Enterprise JavaBeans. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ejb` package instead. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statements with `jakarta.ejb`.\n\n2. **Issue 3:** Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use REST functionality to expose our services. We need to replace the `@Remote` annotation with `@Path` and provide an endpoint. Since REST services are stateless, we can remove the `@Stateless` annotation. For each public method, we need to add `@GET` and `@Path` annotations and replace `@Remote` with `@QueryParam` if needed.\n\n3. **Issue 4:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope such as `@ApplicationScoped`."]
