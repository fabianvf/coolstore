## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `javax.ejb` needs to be updated to `jakarta.ejb` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `@MessageDriven` annotation.

2. **Issue 2:** The same change as Issue 1 is required for the `@MessageDriven` annotation.

3. **Issue 3:** The import statement for `javax.inject` needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `@Inject` annotation.

4. **Issue 4:** The import statement for `javax.jms` needs to be updated to `jakarta.jms` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `Message` and `MessageListener` classes.

5. **Issue 5:** The same change as Issue 4 is required for the `TextMessage` class.

6. **Issue 6:** The same change as Issue 4 is required for the `JMSException` class.

7. **Issue 7:** The same change as Issue 4 is required for the `ActivationConfigProperty` class.

8. **Issue 8:** Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used instead. Therefore, the `@MessageDriven` annotation should be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

9. **Issue 9:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value.

10. **Issue 10:** The same change as Issue 9 is required for the `destinationType` property.

11. **Issue 11:** The same change as Issue 9 is required for the `acknowledgeMode` property.

12. **Issue 12:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This includes the `Message`, `MessageListener`, `TextMessage`, `JMSException`, `ActivationConfigProperty`, and `@MessageDriven` annotation.
