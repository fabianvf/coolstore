## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `javax.ejb` needs to be updated to `jakarta.ejb` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `@Inject` annotation to work correctly.

2. **Issue 2:** The import statement for `javax.ejb` needs to be updated to `jakarta.ejb` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `@MessageDriven` annotation to work correctly. However, as noted in Issue 8, `@MessageDriven` is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

3. **Issue 3:** The import statement for `javax.inject` needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `@Inject` annotation to work correctly.

4. **Issue 4:** The import statement for `javax.jms` needs to be updated to `jakarta.jms` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `Message` and `MessageListener` classes to work correctly.

5. **Issue 5:** The import statement for `javax.jms` needs to be updated to `jakarta.jms` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `TextMessage` class to work correctly.

6. **Issue 6:** The import statement for `javax.jms` needs to be updated to `jakarta.jms` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `Message` class to work correctly.

7. **Issue 7:** The import statement for `javax.jms` needs to be updated to `jakarta.jms` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `TextMessage` class to work correctly.

8. **Issue 8:** Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used instead. Therefore, the `@MessageDriven` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

9. **Issue 9:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

10. **Issue 10:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

11. **Issue 11:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

12. **Issue 12:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

13. **Issue 13:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

14. **Issue 14:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

15. **Issue 15:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This change is necessary for the class to work correctly in Quarkus.

This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change needs to be made on lines 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
