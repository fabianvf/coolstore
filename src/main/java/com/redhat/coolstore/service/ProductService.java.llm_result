## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in the Java EE to Jakarta EE transition. However, Quarkus uses MicroProfile, which doesn't use `jakarta.ejb`. Instead, we can simply remove the `@Stateless` annotation as Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection and doesn't require EJBs.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Jakarta EE. However, Quarkus uses the `javax.inject` package. So, we don't need to change this import statement.

3. **Issue 3:** As mentioned in Issue 1, Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection and doesn't require EJBs. Therefore, we can replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a CDI scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

4. We also need to remove the `CatalogService cm;` field and replace it with a parameter in the methods that use it, as Quarkus' dependency injection is method-based, not field-based.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ProductService {

    @Inject
    public ProductService(CatalogService cm) {
        this.cm = cm;
    }

    private CatalogService cm;

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {
        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);
        if (entity == null)
            return null;

        // Return the entity
        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);
    }

}
```

Please note that you will need to adjust the `CatalogService` injection to match how it is injected in the original Java EE code, as I have made an assumption here. Also, you may need to adjust the package names for `CatalogService` and `CatalogItemEntity` to match your project structure.
