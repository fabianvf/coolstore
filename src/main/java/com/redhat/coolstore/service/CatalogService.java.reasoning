["1. The first issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax.ejb` package to `jakarta.ejb` in Jakarta EE 9. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. The second issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax.inject` package to `jakarta.inject` in Jakarta EE 9. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n3. The third issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax.persistence` package to `jakarta.persistence` in Jakarta EE 9. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n4. The fourth issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax.persistence` package to `jakarta.persistence` in Jakarta EE 9. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n5. The fifth issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax.persistence` package to `jakarta.persistence` in Jakarta EE 9. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n6. The sixth issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax.persistence` package to `jakarta.persistence` in Jakarta EE 9. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n7. The seventh issue highlights the need to remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` and inject it directly. This change is necessary because Quarkus automatically creates the `EntityManager` when the datasource is correctly configured. If a producer is still needed, a qualification should be created for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the EM.\n\n8. The eighth issue highlights the need to replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is necessary because Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope in Quarkus."]
