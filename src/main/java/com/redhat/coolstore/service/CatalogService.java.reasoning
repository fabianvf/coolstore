["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus. This is a result of the transfer of Java EE technologies to the Eclipse Foundation and the subsequent name change to Jakarta EE. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus. We need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n\n3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:** The `javax.persistence` package has been replaced by `jakarta.persistence` in Quarkus. We need to replace all the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n4. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, we don't need to use `@PersistenceContext` to inject a data source. Instead, Quarkus will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. Therefore, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` and directly inject the `EntityManager`.\n\n5. **Issue 8:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped` in Quarkus."]
