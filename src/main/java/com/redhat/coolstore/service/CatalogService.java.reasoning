["1. The first issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. The `javax.ejb` package is no longer valid in Jakarta EE and has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb`.\n\n2. The second issue is related to the first one and requires replacing the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary for the same reasons mentioned above.\n\n3. The third and fourth issues require replacing the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. Again, this change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace.\n\n4. The fifth issue is related to the removal of the `@PersistenceContext` annotation. In Quarkus, the `EntityManager` is automatically injected and does not require the `@PersistenceContext` annotation. This annotation is used in Java EE to inject a data source, but Quarkus creates the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. Therefore, the `@PersistenceContext` annotation is not needed and can be removed.\n\n5. The sixth issue requires replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`. In Java EE, stateless EJBs are used to define a session bean that does not maintain state between method invocations. In Quarkus, CDI beans are used instead of EJBs, and the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used to define a bean that is scoped to the application level."]
