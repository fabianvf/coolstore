["1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `Logger` needs to be updated from `java.util.logging.Logger` to `org.jboss.logging.Logger`. This is because Quarkus uses the JBoss Logging framework instead of the Java Util Logging framework.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The import statement for `@Stateful` and `@Inject` needs to be updated from `javax.ejb` to `jakarta.enterprise.context` and `jakarta.inject` respectively. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) API instead of the Java EE one.\n\n3. **ShoppingCartService:** The `ShoppingCartService` class is a session-scoped CDI bean, which is used to manage the shopping cart for a user session. It uses the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` to process the order and calculate the shipping and insurance costs. It also provides methods to get and update the shopping cart.\n\n4. **ShoppingCart:** The `ShoppingCart` class represents a shopping cart, which contains a list of `ShoppingCartItem`s. It also has methods to calculate the total price of the items in the cart, the total savings from promotions, and the total shipping and insurance costs.\n\n5. **ShoppingCartItem:** The `ShoppingCartItem` class represents an item in a shopping cart, which contains a `Product` and the quantity of the product. It also has methods to calculate the total price and savings from promotions for the item.\n\n6. **Product:** The `Product` class represents a product, which has an item id, a name, a price, and a description.\n\n7. **External Dependencies:** The `ShoppingCartService` class has dependencies on the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor`, `Product`, `ShoppingCart`, and `ShoppingCartItem` classes. These dependencies need to be added to the `pom.xml` file as dependencies.\n\n8. **Imports:** The imports for the `ShoppingCartService` class need to be updated to include the classes and interfaces used in the class."]
