["1. **Replace `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. The `@Stateful` annotation is used to define a stateful session bean, but Quarkus uses a different mechanism for managing stateful components. In Quarkus, we can use `@SessionScoped` annotation from `jakarta.enterprise.context` package to manage the session scope.\n\n2. **Replace `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`**: Similar to the first issue, this change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies, and it is still valid in Quarkus.\n\n3. **Remove `ProductService` and `PromoService` injection**: Since these services are not used in the provided code, we can remove them to simplify the code. If they are used elsewhere in the application, we need to inject them in the constructor or use a different injection mechanism provided by Quarkus.\n\n4. **Replace `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` injection**: `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` is a local variable and not a field, so we cannot inject it using the `@Inject` annotation. Instead, we can create a new instance of `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` in the `checkOutShoppingCart` method.\n\n5. **Replace `ShoppingCart` initialization**: In the Java EE version, a new `ShoppingCart` instance is created in the constructor. In Quarkus, we can use a CDI producer to manage the lifecycle of `ShoppingCart` instances.\n\n6. **Replace `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method**: In the Java EE version, the `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method is used to lookup a remote EJB using JNDI. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject a remote EJB. However, since we removed the `ProductService` and `PromoService` injection, we can also remove the `ShippingServiceRemote` injection and use a different mechanism to calculate shipping costs."]
