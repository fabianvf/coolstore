["1. **Replace `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. The `@Stateful` annotation is used to define a stateful session bean, but in Quarkus, we use the `@SessionScoped` annotation to define a session scoped bean.\n\n2. **Replace `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`**: Similar to the first issue, this change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies, and it works the same way in Quarkus.\n\n3. **Remove the `ProductService` and `PromoService` injections**: Quarkus promotes the use of dependency injection at the method level instead of at the class level. Therefore, we should remove the `@Inject` annotations for `ProductService` and `PromoService` and inject them at the method level instead.\n\n4. **Replace the `javax.naming` import statement with `org.jboss.naming`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the JBoss Naming API instead of the Java EE Naming API. The `InitialContext` class is used to lookup remote EJBs, but in Quarkus, we use the `NamingContext` class instead.\n\n5. **Replace the `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method with a `@Inject` annotation**: Instead of manually looking up the `ShippingServiceRemote` EJB, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject it directly into the `ShoppingCartService` class.\n\n6. **Replace the `java.util.logging.Logger` import statement with `org.jboss.logging.Logger`**: This change is required because Quarkus uses the JBoss Logging API instead of the Java Util Logging API.\n\n7. **Replace the `Hashtable` import statement with `java.util.Collections`**: This change is required because Quarkus promotes the use of immutable collections instead of mutable collections.\n\n8. **Replace the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` injection with a method level injection**: Instead of injecting `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` at the class level, we should inject it at the method level where it is used.\n\n9. **Remove the `priceShoppingCart()` method**: This method is not used in the `checkOutShoppingCart()` method, so we can remove it.\n\n10. **Replace the `getProduct()` method with a method level injection**: Instead of manually looking up the `Product` EJB, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject it directly into the `getProduct()` method."]
