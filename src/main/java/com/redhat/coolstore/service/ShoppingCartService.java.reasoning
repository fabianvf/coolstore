["1. **Issue 1**: The `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Quarkus. This is due to the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE, where the package names have been changed to reflect the new ownership. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb.Stateful` import statement with `jakarta.ejb.Stateful`.\n\n2. **Issue 2**: Similarly, the `javax.inject` package has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE implementation for dependency injection. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.inject.Inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject.Inject`.\n\n3. **Issue 3**: The `javax.naming` package is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses a different approach for dependency injection and resource lookup. In this case, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `ProductService` and `PromoService` beans. However, the `ShippingServiceRemote` bean needs to be replaced with a local interface or a CDI bean.\n\n4. **Issue 4**: The `InitialContext` and `Context` classes are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `ProductService` and `PromoService` beans. However, the `ShippingServiceRemote` bean needs to be replaced with a local interface or a CDI bean.\n\n5. **Issue 5**: The `Hashtable` class is not recommended for use in Java SE 7 and later. Instead, we can use the `Map` interface and the `HashMap` class.\n\n6. **Issue 6**: The `NamingException` class is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `@Resource` annotation to inject the `ProductService` and `PromoService` beans. However, the `ShippingServiceRemote` bean needs to be replaced with a local interface or a CDI bean."]
