## Reasoning

1. To migrate the `OrderService` from Java EE to Quarkus, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.
2. Similarly, we need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.
3. The `@Stateless` annotation should be replaced with a scope such as `@ApplicationScoped`.
4. In Java EE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed to inject a data source. However, in Quarkus, the bean is automatically created by correctly setting up the datasource. Therefore, using a `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` is illegal in Quarkus.
5. If a `@Produces` annotation for the `EntityManager` is used and it is not needed after configuring the datasource, it should be removed and the `@Inject` annotation should be used instead.
6. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` should be created, as well as every injection point for the EM.

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class OrderService {

    @Inject
    private EntityManager em;

    public void save(Order order) {
        em.persist(order);
    }

    public List<Order> getOrders() {
        CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
        CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);
        Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);
        criteria.select(member);
        return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();
    }

    public Order getOrderById(long id) {
        return em.find(Order.class, id);
    }
}
