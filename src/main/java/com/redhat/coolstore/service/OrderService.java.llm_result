## Reasoning

1. The first issue highlights the need to update the import statement from `javax.ejb` to `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is required for the `@Stateless` annotation.

2. The second issue indicates that we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is required for the `@Inject` annotation.

3. The third issue highlights the need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is required for all the `javax.persistence` annotations and classes.

4. The fourth issue is related to the third one and requires the same change.

5. The fifth issue is related to the third one and requires the same change.

6. The sixth issue is related to the third one and requires the same change.

7. In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed in order to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand, will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. Therefore, we can remove the `@PersistenceContext` annotation and `@Inject` the `EntityManager`.

8. Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import java.util.List;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;
import jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;
import jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder;
import jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery;
import jakarta.persistence.criteria.Root;

@ApplicationScoped
public class OrderService {

  @Inject
  private EntityManager em;

  public void save(Order order) {
    em.persist(order);
  }

  public List<Order> getOrders() {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);
    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);
    criteria.select(member);
    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();
  }

  public Order getOrderById(long id) {
    return em.find(Order.class, id);
  }
}
```

Regarding the pom.xml and imports, since we are not using any external dependencies and all the imports are from the Jakarta EE API, there are no changes needed in the pom.xml. However, if there were any external dependencies, we would need to check their compatibility with Quarkus and update them accordingly.
