## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** Java EE and Jakarta EE use different packages for annotations. Java EE uses `javax.annotation` while Jakarta EE and Quarkus use `jakarta.annotation`. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, EJBs are replaced by CDI in Quarkus. The `@Stateless` annotation is replaced by a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

3. **Issue 3:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package is replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus.

4. **Issue 4 & 5:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.jms` package is replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Quarkus.

5. **Issue 6 & 7:** Quarkus uses Micrometer for metrics and tracing. Topics are replaced by Emitters and Channels. The `Topic` is injected with the `@Channel` annotation and the `@Resource` annotation is no longer needed.

6. **Issue 8 & 9:** Similar to Issue 4, JMS elements should be replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.

7. **Issue 10:** This is covered in Issue 2.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.jms.JMSContext;
import jakarta.jms.Emitter;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import org.jboss.logging.Logger;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Inject
    private JMSContext context;

    @Resource(name = "java:/topic/orders")
    private Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;

    public Uni<Void> process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        return Uni.createFrom().voidItem(() -> ordersEmitter.emit(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart)));
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

The updated file uses the `Uni` class from Mutiny to handle asynchronous processing. The `process` method now returns a `Uni<Void>` which represents a deferred computation that can complete with a result or fail with an exception. The `Uni.createFrom().voidItem()` method is used to create a `Uni` that completes immediately with no result. The `emit` method is used to send a message to the Emitter.

The `@Resource` annotation is used with the `name` attribute instead of the `lookup` attribute to specify the JNDI name of the Emitter.

The `jboss.logging.Logger` is used instead of `java.util.logging.Logger` to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.
