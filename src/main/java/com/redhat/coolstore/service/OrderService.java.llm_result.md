## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The package `javax.ejb` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.ejb` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

2. **Issue 2:** The package `javax.inject` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.inject` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

3. **Issue 3:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

4. **Issue 4:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

5. **Issue 5:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

6. **Issue 6:** The package `javax.persistence` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package `jakarta.persistence` for Jakarta EE, which is the new package naming for Java EE technologies.

7. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, the `@PersistenceContext` annotation is not needed to inject a data source. Instead, Quarkus will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` needs to be removed, and the `EntityManager` should be injected directly.

8. **Issue 8:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;
import jakarta.persistence.CriteriaBuilder;
import jakarta.persistence.CriteriaQuery;
import jakarta.persistence.Root;

@ApplicationScoped
public class OrderService {

  @Inject
  private EntityManager em;

  public void save(Order order) {
    em.persist(order);
  }

  public List<Order> getOrders() {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);
    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);
    criteria.select(member);
    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();
  }

  public Order getOrderById(long id) {
    return em.find(Order.class, id);
  }
}
```

## Additional Information

In this updated file, we have replaced the `javax` package imports with the `jakarta` package imports, and we have removed the `@PersistenceContext` annotation and replaced the `@Stateless` annotation with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation. This will allow the `EntityManager` to be injected directly, and the `OrderService` to be used as a CDI bean. Additionally, we have removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager`, as it is not needed in Quarkus.
