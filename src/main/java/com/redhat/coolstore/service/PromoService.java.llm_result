## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issue found from static analysis, which is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` namespace used in Java EE.

2. The `Serializable` interface is not needed in Quarkus as it does not require objects to be serialized when they are passed between JVMs. Therefore, we can remove the `Serializable` import statement and the `implements Serializable` clause.

3. The `promotionSet` field is currently initialized in the constructor. In Quarkus, we can use a constructor with arguments to initialize the field. We can also remove the `setPromotions` method since it is not needed in Quarkus.

4. The `promotionSet` field is currently returned as a new `HashSet` in the `getPromotions` method. In Quarkus, we can return the field directly since it is immutable.

5. The `promotionMap` field is currently created in the `applyCartItemPromotions` method. In Quarkus, we can create the field as a local variable in the method to improve performance.

6. The `promotionMap` field is currently populated using a for-each loop. In Quarkus, we can use the `Map.putAll` method to populate the field more efficiently.

7. The `shoppingCart` field is currently passed as an argument to the `applyCartItemPromotions` and `applyShippingPromotions` methods. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Context` annotation to inject the field directly into the methods.

8. The `promotionSet` field is currently populated using a constructor. In Quarkus, we can use a Quarkus extension to populate the field from a configuration file.

9. The `promotionMap` field is currently populated using a for-each loop. In Quarkus, we can use the `Stream.collect` method to populate the field more efficiently.

10. The `promotionMap` field is currently used to retrieve promotions for each product. In Quarkus, we can use a `ConcurrentHashMap` to improve performance and reduce contention.
