["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in the Java EE to Jakarta EE transition. However, Quarkus uses MicroProfile, which doesn't use `jakarta.ejb`. Instead, we can simply remove the `@Stateless` annotation as Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection and doesn't require EJBs.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Jakarta EE. However, Quarkus uses the `javax.inject` package. So, we don't need to change this import statement.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** As mentioned in Issue 1, Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection and doesn't require EJBs. Therefore, we can replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a CDI scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n4. We also need to remove the `CatalogService cm;` field and replace it with a parameter in the methods that use it, as Quarkus' dependency injection is method-based, not field-based."]
