["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is for Java EE, and it is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ejb` package, which is the new package name for Jakarta EE. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb.Stateless` annotation with `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`. This annotation is used to define a CDI bean, which is the equivalent of an EJB in Quarkus.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package, which is the new package name for Jakarta EE. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation with `jakarta.inject.Inject`. This annotation is used to inject dependencies into a CDI bean.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`. In Quarkus, CDI beans are used instead of EJBs. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is used to create a CDI bean that is created once per request."]
