["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is for Java EE, and it is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ejb` package, which is the equivalent in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package, which is the equivalent in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** Stateless EJBs are not used in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses CDI beans. The `@Stateless` annotation is replaced with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped` or `@RequestScoped`. This change is necessary to convert the EJB to a CDI bean."]
