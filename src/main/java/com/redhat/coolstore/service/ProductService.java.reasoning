["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is for Java EE, and it is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ejb` package, which is the equivalent in Jakarta EE. The `@Stateless` annotation is used to define a stateless session bean in Java EE, but in Quarkus, we can use the `@RequestScoped` annotation to define a request-scoped CDI bean.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package, which is the equivalent in Jakarta EE. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies in both Java EE and Quarkus.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** Stateless EJBs are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use CDI beans with a specific scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`, `@RequestScoped`, or `@Dependent`. In this case, we can use `@RequestScoped` to define a request-scoped CDI bean."]
