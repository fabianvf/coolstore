["1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `javax.ejb.Stateless` needs to be updated to `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace for its dependencies, which includes the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package for CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) scopes.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The import statement for `javax.inject.Inject` needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject.Inject`. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace for its dependencies, which includes the `jakarta.inject` package for injection annotations.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The `@Stateless` annotation is not necessary in Quarkus, as it does not use EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans). Instead, it uses CDI for dependency injection. Therefore, the `@Stateless` annotation can be replaced with a CDI scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped` or `@RequestScoped`. In this case, `@RequestScoped` is the appropriate scope annotation, as it indicates that the bean is created for each HTTP request."]
