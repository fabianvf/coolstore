["1. **Issue 1:** The import statement `javax.ejb` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which has renamed the package from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is required in lines 3, 4, and 5.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used instead. The `@MessageDriven` annotation is an EJB annotation and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is required in line 14.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value. This change is required in line 15.\n\n4. **Issue 4:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This change is required in lines 6, 7, 8, and 9."]
