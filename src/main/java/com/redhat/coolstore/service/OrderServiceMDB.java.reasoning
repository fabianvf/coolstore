["1. **Issue 1-7:** The Java EE packages have been replaced by Jakarta EE packages in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. Quarkus being a Jakarta EE compatible framework, we need to replace `javax` with `jakarta` for all the imports.\n\n2. **Issue 8:** Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we use Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) which is a standardized way to use dependency injection in Jakarta EE. We will replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n3. **Issue 9-11:** The `@MessageDriven` annotation with `activationConfig` properties is used in Java EE to specify the JMS destination. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Incoming` annotation from MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to specify the JMS destination.\n\n4. **Issue 12-15:** Quarkus uses SmallRye/Microprofile implementation for JMS which is different from the Java EE/Jakarta EE JMS implementation. We need to remove and replace all references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents."]
