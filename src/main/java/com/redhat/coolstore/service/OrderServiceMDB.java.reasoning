["1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `javax.ejb` needs to be updated to `jakarta.ejb` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is necessary for the `@MessageDriven` annotation.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The same change as Issue 1 needs to be applied to the `@MessageDriven` annotation. This annotation is used to define a message-driven bean, which is a type of EJB that is triggered by a message on a JMS destination. In Quarkus, this functionality is provided by the SmallRye Reactive Messaging library, which uses the `@Incoming` annotation instead.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The import statement for `javax.inject` needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject` for the same reason as Issues 1 and 2. This change is necessary for the `@Inject` annotation.\n\n4. **Issue 4:** The import statement for `javax.jms` needs to be updated to `jakarta.jms` for the same reason as Issues 1, 2, and 3. This change is necessary for the `Message` and `MessageListener` interfaces.\n\n5. **Issue 5:** The same change as Issue 4 needs to be applied to the `TextMessage` interface.\n\n6. **Issue 6:** The same change as Issue 4 needs to be applied to the `JMSException` class.\n\n7. **Issue 7:** The same change as Issue 4 needs to be applied to the `Message` interface again.\n\n8. **Issue 8:** Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) is used to manage the lifecycle of objects and inject dependencies. Therefore, the `@MessageDriven` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n9. **Issue 9:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value. This is the Quarkus/SmallRye equivalent of the `destinationLookup` property.\n\n10. **Issue 10:** The same change as Issue 9 needs to be applied to the `destinationType` property.\n\n11. **Issue 11:** The same change as Issue 9 needs to be applied to the `acknowledgeMode` property.\n\n12. **Issue 12:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses the SmallRye Reactive Messaging library instead of the JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS library."]
