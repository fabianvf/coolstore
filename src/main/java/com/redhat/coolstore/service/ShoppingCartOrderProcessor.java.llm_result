## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `javax.annotation` needs to be updated to `jakarta.annotation` because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, not Java EE. This is a breaking change in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards, where the `javax.*` package namespace was changed to `jakarta.*`.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.ejb` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb`. However, this is not necessary in this case because we are removing the `@Stateless` annotation in favor of a CDI scope.

3. **Issue 3:** The `javax.inject` import statement needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject` for the same reason as Issues 1 and 2.

4. **Issue 4 & 5:** The `javax.jms` import statements need to be updated to `jakarta.jms` for the same reason as Issues 1, 2, and 3.

5. **Issue 6 & 7:** JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API, which provides a more efficient and reactive way of sending messages compared to the traditional JMS API.

6. **Issue 8 & 9:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API, which provides a more efficient and reactive way of sending messages compared to the traditional JMS API.

7. **Issue 10:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, not EJBs.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import org.jboss.logging.Logger;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

@RequestScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    private Emitter<String> ordersTopicEmitter;

    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        ordersTopicEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));
    }
}
```

Additionally, the `pom.xml` file will need to be updated to include the required Quarkus dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-reactive-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-context-propagation</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Note that the specific dependencies required will depend on the messaging system used (in this case, Kafka).
