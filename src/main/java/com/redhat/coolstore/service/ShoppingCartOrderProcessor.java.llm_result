## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.annotation` package is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.annotation` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, `javax.ejb` is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.ejb` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

3. **Issue 3:** The `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.inject` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

4. **Issue 4 & 5:** The `javax.jms` package is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.jms` in Jakarta EE. However, in the context of this code, it's not just about changing the package, but also replacing JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is a significant change and requires understanding the Quarkus reactive messaging model.

5. **Issue 6 & 7:** These issues provide the solution for Issues 4 & 5. The solution involves injecting an `Emitter` for a specific channel and using it to send messages. This is a significant change and requires understanding the Quarkus reactive messaging model.

6. **Issue 8 & 9:** These issues reiterate the need to remove Java EE JMS elements and replace them with Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This has been addressed in Issues 4, 5, 6, and 7.

7. **Issue 10:** Stateless EJBs are not used in Quarkus. Instead, CDI beans with a specific scope (like `@ApplicationScoped`) are used. This change has been made in the solution.
