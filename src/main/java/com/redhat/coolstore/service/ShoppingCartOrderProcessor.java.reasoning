["1. **Issue 1:** The import statement for `javax.annotation` needs to be updated to `jakarta.annotation` because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, not Java EE. This is a breaking change in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards, where the `javax.*` package namespace was changed to `jakarta.*`.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.ejb` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb`. However, this is not necessary in this case because we are removing the `@Stateless` annotation in favor of a CDI scope.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The `javax.inject` import statement needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject` for the same reason as Issues 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Issue 4 & 5:** The `javax.jms` import statements need to be updated to `jakarta.jms` for the same reason as Issues 1, 2, and 3.\n\n5. **Issue 6 & 7:** JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API, which provides a more efficient and reactive way of sending messages compared to the traditional JMS API.\n\n6. **Issue 8 & 9:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API, which provides a more efficient and reactive way of sending messages compared to the traditional JMS API.\n\n7. **Issue 10:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, not EJBs."]
