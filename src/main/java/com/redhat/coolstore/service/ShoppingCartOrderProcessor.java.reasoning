["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.annotation` package has been replaced by `jakarta.annotation` in Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9. This is a package renaming that happened as part of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, so we need to use `jakarta.annotation` instead of `javax.annotation`.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9. However, it's important to note that EJBs are not typically used in Quarkus, as it's a more modern, lightweight framework. Instead, we can use CDI beans, which we will address in Issue 10.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The `javax.inject` package has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9. We need to update this import statement to use the new package.\n\n4. **Issue 4 & 5:** The `javax.jms` package has been replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9. We need to update these import statements to use the new package.\n\n5. **Issue 6 & 7:** JMS `Topic`s are not typically used in Quarkus. Instead, we can use Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is a more lightweight and efficient way to handle messaging in Quarkus.\n\n6. **Issue 8 & 9:** We need to remove all references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements and replace them with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses SmallRye/Microprofile for its implementations, not JavaEE/JakartaEE.\n\n7. **Issue 10:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, not EJBs."]
