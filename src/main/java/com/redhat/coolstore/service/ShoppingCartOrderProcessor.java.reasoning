["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.annotation` package is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.annotation` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, `javax.ejb` is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.ejb` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.inject` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n4. **Issue 4 & 5:** The `javax.jms` package is for Java EE, and it has been replaced with `jakarta.jms` in Jakarta EE. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n5. **Issue 6 & 7:** JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is a design decision in Quarkus to simplify the programming model and reduce the complexity of managing JMS resources.\n\n6. **Issue 8 & 9:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n7. **Issue 10:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope like `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, and the `@Stateless` annotation is not recognized."]
