["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.annotation` package has been replaced by `jakarta.annotation` in Java EE 8 and later. This is a namespacing change to avoid conflicts with other specifications that might use the same package name. Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace, so we need to update the import statement accordingly.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.ejb` package has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Java EE 8 and later. However, Quarkus does not use EJBs. Instead, it uses CDI for dependency injection. So, we will replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a Quarkus-specific scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** This issue is the same as Issue 1. We need to update the `javax.inject` package to `jakarta.inject`.\n\n4. **Issue 4 & 5:** These issues are the same as Issue 1. We need to update the `javax.jms` package to `jakarta.jms`.\n\n5. **Issue 6 & 7:** JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API, which provides a more flexible and reactive approach to messaging. We will replace the `Topic` with an `Emitter` and the `@Resource` annotation with `@Inject` and `@Channel`.\n\n6. **Issue 8 & 9:** These issues are the same as Issue 1. We need to replace all references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents."]
