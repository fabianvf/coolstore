["1. The first issue to address is the import statement for `javax.inject.Inject`. This import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject.Inject` to be consistent with Quarkus conventions. This change is required because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace.\n\n2. The second issue is the usage of JMS `Topic`s. In Quarkus, we should replace JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This change is necessary because Quarkus promotes the use of reactive messaging and Micrometer for monitoring purposes.\n\n3. The third issue is the usage of JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements. These elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This change is required because Quarkus uses SmallRye and Microprofile for reactive messaging and other features."]
