["1. **Issue 1**: The Java EE API `javax.inject` has been replaced by the Jakarta EE API `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus. This is a breaking change and all imports need to be updated accordingly.\n\n2. **Issue 2**: Quarkus uses the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation for JMS which doesn't support the Java EE `Topic` class. Instead, it uses `Emitter`s that feed a `Channel`. The `@Channel` annotation is used to specify the name of the channel, which is the same as the name of the JMS topic.\n\n3. **Issue 3**: As Quarkus uses the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation for JMS, all references to Java EE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents."]
