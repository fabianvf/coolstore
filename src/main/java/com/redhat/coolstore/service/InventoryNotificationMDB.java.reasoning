["1. **Issue 1:** The import statement `javax.inject.Inject` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject.Inject` because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has renamed the `javax` package to `jakarta`. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** JMS Topics should be replaced with Micrometer Emitters feeding a Channel. This is because Quarkus uses the SmallRye/MicroProfile implementation for messaging, which relies on Emitters and Channels instead of JMS Topics. This change is necessary to use the Quarkus messaging system.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses the SmallRye/MicroProfile implementation for messaging, which does not use the JMS API directly. This change is necessary to use the Quarkus messaging system."]
