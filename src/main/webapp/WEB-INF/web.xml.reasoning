["The input file is a `web.xml` file from a Java EE application. This file is used to configure the web application and its components. However, Quarkus does not use `web.xml` for configuration. Instead, Quarkus uses annotation-based configuration and properties files.\n\nThe issue found in the `web.xml` file is related to session replication. Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by node failure. However, in a cloud environment, data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart. The recommendations are to review the session replication usage, disable HTTP session clustering, or re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.\n\nIn Quarkus, we can use the `@SessionScoped` annotation to create session-scoped beans. However, Quarkus does not support session replication out of the box. We can use a distributed data grid, such as Infinispan, to store session data. Infinispan can be easily integrated with Quarkus using the `quarkus-infinispan-client` extension.\n\nTo migrate the `web.xml` file to Quarkus, we need to:\n\n1. Remove the `web.xml` file.\n2. Annotate the session-scoped beans with `@SessionScoped`.\n3. Configure Infinispan as a distributed data grid."]
