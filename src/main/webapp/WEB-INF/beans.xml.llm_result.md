## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static source code analysis. The first three issues all pertain to updating the XML schema namespace and version. This is necessary because the Java EE namespace and schema have been migrated to the Jakarta EE namespace and schema.

2. To address Issue 1, we need to replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` on line 18.

3. To address Issue 2, we need to replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` on line 20.

4. To address Issue 3, we need to replace `beans_1_1.xsd` with `beans_3_0.xsd` and update the version attribute to `"3.0"` on line 21.

5. After addressing these issues, we need to consider the final issue, which is that the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored in Quarkus. This means that we can remove the `beans.xml` file entirely, as it serves no purpose in our Quarkus application.

6. Since we are removing the `beans.xml` file, we need to ensure that our Quarkus application still functions correctly. This may involve updating any dependencies or configurations that rely on the `beans.xml` file.

7. In our case, since we are migrating from Java EE to Quarkus, we may need to update our dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to use Quarkus-specific dependencies. This may involve removing any Java EE dependencies and adding Quarkus dependencies instead.

8. We also need to update our imports to reflect the new Quarkus dependencies and configurations. This may involve removing any Java EE imports and adding Quarkus imports instead.

## Updated File

Since the `beans.xml` file is no longer needed in Quarkus, we can remove it entirely. Therefore, there is no updated file to provide.

## Additional Information

When migrating from Java EE to Quarkus, it is important to consider the following:

1. Quarkus is designed for cloud-native applications, so it may require a different approach to development than Java EE.

2. Quarkus uses a different build system than Java EE, so you may need to update your build configurations accordingly.

3. Quarkus has a different dependency injection system than Java EE, so you may need to update your dependency injection configurations.

4. Quarkus has a different configuration system than Java EE, so you may need to update your configuration settings.

5. Quarkus has a different deployment model than Java EE, so you may need to update your deployment configurations.

6. Quarkus has a different runtime environment than Java EE, so you may need to update your runtime configurations.

7. Quarkus has a different development experience than Java EE, so you may need to update your development workflows.

8. Quarkus has a different community than Java EE, so you may need to update your support and collaboration workflows.

9. Quarkus has a different ecosystem than Java EE, so you may need to update your tooling and integrations.

10. Quarkus has a different architecture than Java EE, so you may need to update your application design and architecture.

When migrating from Java EE to Quarkus, it is important to consider these factors and plan accordingly. It may be helpful to consult the Quarkus documentation and community for guidance on migrating your specific application.

6. Since we are removing the `beans.xml` file, we need to ensure that our Quarkus application is configured to use CDI. We can do this by adding the `quarkus-arc` dependency to our `pom.xml` file.

7. We also need to update our `import` statements to reflect the new Jakarta EE namespace.

## Updated File

Since the `beans.xml` file is no longer needed in Quarkus, there is no updated file to provide. Instead, we need to remove the `beans.xml` file and add the `quarkus-arc` dependency to our `pom.xml` file.

## pom.xml Dependency Update

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-arc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
## Updated Imports

Update your Java code imports to reflect the new Jakarta EE namespace:

Before:
```java
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
```
After:
```java
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
```
Note that the `javax` package has been updated to `jakarta`.
