["1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static analysis. The primary issue is that the `beans.xml` file is using the Java EE namespace and schema location, which is not compatible with Quarkus as it uses the Jakarta EE namespace and schema location.\n\n2. To resolve this issue, we need to replace all instances of `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` and update the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd` with the version attribute set to `\"3.0\"`.\n\n3.

Therefore, it is recommended to remove the `beans.xml` file from the application."]
