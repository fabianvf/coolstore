## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static analysis. The primary issue is that the `beans.xml` file is using the Java EE namespace and schema location, which is not compatible with Quarkus as it uses the Jakarta EE namespace and schema location.

2. To resolve this issue, we need to replace all instances of `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` and update the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd` with the version attribute set to `"3.0"`.

3. However, after making these changes, the `beans.xml` descriptor content will be ignored in Quarkus as it uses a different approach for CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) than Java EE. Therefore, it is recommended to remove the `beans.xml` file from the application.

## Updated File

Since it is recommended to remove the `beans.xml` file in Quarkus, there is no updated file to provide. Instead, you can safely remove the `beans.xml` file from your Quarkus application. If you still want to keep the `beans.xml` file for any reason, then the updated file would look like this:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
          https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee
          https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_3_0.xsd"
       bean-discovery-mode="all">
</beans>
```
However, please note that keeping the `beans.xml` file in a Quarkus application may not have any effect and is not recommended.
